What is a RESTful API ?\n","\n"," â–¶ A RESTful API is a web service that follows REST principles, allowing clients to interact with server-side resources using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n","\n","2. Explain the concept of API specification.\n","\n"," â–¶ An API specification provides a broad understanding of how an API behaves and how the API links with other APIs. It explains how the API functions and the results to expect when using the API. A good example of an API specification is the OpenAPI Specification.\n","\n","3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs ?\n","\n"," â–¶ Flask is a popular Python web framework that is widely used to design sophisticated web applications, APIs, and microservices. As a result, this framework's simplicity, flexibility, scalability, reliability, and ability to process increased traffic are the key factors behind its popularity among businesses.\n","\n","4. What is routing in Flask ?\n","\n"," â–¶ Routing in Flask is the process of mapping URLs to Python functions (also called view functions). It tells the application which function should run when a user visits a specific URL.\n","\n"," Example:-\n"],"metadata":{"id":"2VzR-l-l-wlV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from flask import Flask\n","app = Flask(__name__)\n","\n","@app.route('/')\n","def home():\n","    return \"Welcome to the homepage!\"\n","\n","@app.route('/about')\n","def about():\n","    return \"This is the About page.\""],"metadata":{"id":"Z7G6VBKRN93C"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5.

What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs ?\n","\n"," â–¶ In a RESTful API, HTTP methods (Create,Get,Put,Delete) are used to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources.\n","\n","7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask ?\n","\n"," â–¶ This decorator transforms a function into a route that can be accessed via a browser without explicitly calling the function in your code.\n","\n","8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods ?\n","\n"," â–¶ The GET and POST methods are two of the most commonly used HTTP request types in web development, especially when working with RESTful APIs. The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server without making any changes to the data or server state. It sends the data in the URL as query parameters, making it visible in the browser's address bar and easy to bookmark or cache. In contrast, the POST method is used to submit data to the server, such as form inputs, file uploads, or new records. It sends data in the request body, which is not visible in the URL and allows sending larger and more complex data structures securely. Unlike GET, POST requests are not cached, not bookmarked, and they can modify server data, making them suitable for create or update operations. While GET is ideal for simple, safe reads, POST is better suited for operations that involve changes or sensitive information.\n","\n","9.

How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.) ?\n","\n"," â–¶ In Flask, static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images are served from a dedicated folder named static/ by default.

What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API ?\n","\n"," â–¶ An API specification is a detailed document or blueprint that describes how an API should behave. It defines the endpoints, HTTP methods, request parameters, response formats, status codes, and authentication methods. It serves as a contract between the backend (API developers) and frontend or external users (consumers of the API).\n","\n","19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API ?\n","\n"," â–¶ HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a web server (including Flask) in response to a client's request. They indicate whether a request was successful, caused an error, or requires further action. In Flask APIs, status codes are critical because they help communicate the result of the API call to the client in a standardized and machine-readable way."],"metadata":{"id":"ra3ueGldUY-R"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["20.
